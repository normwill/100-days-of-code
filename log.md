# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 13, 2017 


**Today's Progress**: Working through freecodecacmp and going over HTML5 and CSS. Becoming more comfortable with HTML than I was when I began my coding bootcamp the first week of August.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.


### Day 2: September 14, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on IDs and Classes. Also worked on margin and padding

**Thoughts**: Understanding padding and margins better. I didn't realize that IDs overrides Classes and the second class declared always overrides the first one.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
